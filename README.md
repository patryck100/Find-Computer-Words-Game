# Find-Computer-Words-Game is a Java project created using NeatBeans

It is a 2 players game:
- The user choose how many rounds will be played
- The application displays 12 random letters
- The user has to make a valid word using only the 12 letter without repeating it. 
- Player 2 can not repeat word from player 1
- By the end of each round the game displays how many points each user got and who is winning 
- When the last round is over, the application displays the winner (player who got more points).
